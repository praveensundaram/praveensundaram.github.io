			<p>Hello! I am <b>Praveen Sundaram,</b> and I hail from Bangalore, India. I was born in Seattle, Washington, and my family moved back to India when I was 3. I am currently studying Computer Science, with a certificate in Entrepreneurship. I love entrepreneurship and plan on starting my own start up once I graduate. I enjoy studying computer science, and am currently fluent in Java, Python, HTML and CSS. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing tennis, reading books and playing card games like bluff. I am currently reading <i>Born a Crime by Trevor Noah</i> and <i>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.</i> Furthermore, I have been playing tennis for the better part of a decade now and really enjoy it! I am excited to play & make friends with other tennis players here on campus! I enjoy playing card game, especially poker and bluff. </p>
